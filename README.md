# Hello-MicroBlaze
## Demonstration of Hello World Program by Implementation of MicroBlaze Processor on FPGA
---

___This is my first repository in github, so any suggestions and feedbacks are welcomed ! 
For connecting with me for future projects, you can connect with [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aswinsilicon/)___

This project has only one motive. It is to experiment with MicroBlaze processor, and thereby try to create a serial connection between the computer and the MicroBlaze Processor using UART communication. This first project is a primary resource for me to practice, with the open source toolchain and definitely to keep a documentation that is easily understandable by anyone who later tries to practice it the same way. I will keep on updating this repository whenever it is required.

Let's Start

---

### NOTE: This repository follows Linux based Operating System. I have used [Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
#### Make sure all the libraries that are necessary for all these below software are installed in your system. Also this would cost a lot of space as well so I suggest to get atleast 250GB of storage and atleast 8GB RAM.

### You may go [here](#5-MicroBlaze-An-Introduction), if you already have Ubuntu and the needed softwares along with all the necessary files installed in your system.


## 1. Ubuntu Setup
### I would strongly suggest to Dual Boot your system rather than only keeping Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS on your system.
  - You can follow the procedure shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjQGGLa_Dic).
  - Make sure you have a minimum 16GB Pendrive available with you.

## 2. Necessary Libraries Installation
- Run the following commands one by one after proper installation of Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade-y
$ sudo apt install build-essential
$ sudo apt install libtinfo-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libtinfo5
$ sudo apt install libncurses5
$ sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5
$ sudo apt-get install putty
```

## 3. Xilinx Unified Software Setup
### I have used 2023.2 version of the Xilinx Unified Software.
### NOTE: Before going for the installation, make sure all the libraries mentioned above (Section 2) are installed properly on your system, else there is a chance that the installer may get hang at the final processing part.
  - You can download the Linux Self Extracting Web Installer from this [site](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis/2023-2.html)
  - I would suggest installing the Vitis Core Development Kit - 2023.2, which is under the section Vitis (SW Developer) tab.
  - Once downloaded, note down the name of the installed 'bin' file name. You will need to remember this in order to open the installer through the Ubuntu Terminal.
  - In my case, it is 'FPGAs_AdaptiveSoCs_Unified_2023.2_1013_2256_Lin64.bin'.
  - Now, open the Ubuntu Terminal and type the following commands to open Linux Self Extracting Web Installer by Xilinx.
```
$ cd $HOME/Downloads
$ chmod u+x FPGAs_AdaptiveSoCs_Unified_2023.2_1013_2256_Lin64.bin
$ sudo ./FPGAs_AdaptiveSoCs_Unified_2023.2_1013_2256_Lin64.bin
```
- ### Note that you need to replace the file name according to your version in order to open the installer.
 - Login with your credentials.
 - Select Vitis among the different options.
 - Click on next.
 - Choose the installation directory where you want to store the files. I would suggest to store in '/tools/Xilinx'.
 - Install.
 - Once installation is complete, we must ensure all our necessary softwares are properly loading. To check, proceed with the following commands on the Ubuntu Terminal:
 - ### Vivado-
   ```
   $ /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.2/bin/vivado
   ```
   - The Vivado home page should look like this.
    ![The home page should look like this.](./Images/vivado_start.png)
- ### Vitis Unified Software-
   ```
   $ /tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/bin/vitis
   ```
   - The Uninfied IDE home page should look like this.
   - ![The home page should look like this.](./Images/vitis_unified_ide_start.png)
- ### Installing the Development Board Definition in the Vitis Software
  #### I will be using Digilent Basys 3 FPGA Board
 - the github link from where to download the master.zip [file](https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards/archive/master.zip)
 - Extract the zip file
 - go to /vivado-boards-master/new/board_files and copy basys3 folder
 - paste the folder to /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.2/data/boards/board_files directory (create a boards_files folder if missing and then paste it)
     
## 4. Visual Studio Code Setup
- I would suggest you the download the Visual Studio Code by referring to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLm2EHIaxOo)
- Replace apt, Install GDEBI.
- Using GDEBI Package Installer it is easier to open Visual Studio Code.
- Now download '.deb package (64-bit) ' from this [site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_install-vs-code-on-linux)
- Once it gets downloaded, open the package using GDEBI Package Installer.
- Now you may see the Visual Studio Code icon on the Ubuntu 'Show Tabs' section.
- Open it to verify whether it loads well.
  - The Visual Studio Code home page should look like this.
  - ![The home page should look like this.](./Images/visual_studio_code_start.png)
  
### 4.1 Install Serial Monitor
- Click on Extensions.
- Search for Serial Monitor 
- Make sure that the publisher is Microsoft Corporation.
  - It should be like this.
- Click on install.
- To make sure the proper installation, use key board shortcut 'Ctrl+Shift+P' to open search bar, type serial monitor.
- Click on the option- 'View: Toggle Serial Monitor'
