This project has only one motive. It is to experiment with MicroBlaze processor, and thereby try to create a serial connection between the computer and the MicroBlaze Processor using UART communication. This first project is a primary resource for me to practice, with the open source toolchain and definitely to keep a documentation that is easily understandable by anyone who later tries to practice it the same way.

Let's Start

### NOTE: This repository follows Linux based Operating System. I have used [Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
### Make sure all the libraries that are necessary for all these below software are installed in your system. Also this would cost a lot of space as well so I suggest to get atleast 250GB of storage and atleast 8GB RAM.
