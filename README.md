This project has only one motive. It is to experiment with MicroBlaze processor, and thereby try to create a serial connection between the computer and the MicroBlaze Processor using UART communication. This first project is a primary resource for me to practice, with the open source toolchain and definitely to keep a documentation that is easily understandable by anyone who later tries to practice it the same way.

Let's Start
